# Haskell Implementation of Ant Colony Optimization

[TOC]

## Purpose
This project is designed to test the Ant Colony Optimization (will be often referred in this document as ACO) in Haskell, a Functional Programming language, on the Travelling Salesman Person problem (which will be referred as TSP).

## Contents of the project
### Doku File
The project contains a documentation in Doku folder which addresses the results of ACO + TSP on different benchmarks and also TSP + 3 different algorithms.

## Setup
You will need to have two windows opened:
- `emacs` -- a text editor
- `system terminal` + `GHCi`
__What to install__:
```commandline
sudo snap install emacs --classic
sudo apt install ghc
```
