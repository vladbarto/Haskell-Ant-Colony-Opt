# Haskell Implementation of Ant Colony Optimization

[TOC]

## Purpose
This project is designed to test the Ant Colony Optimization (will be often referred in this document as ACO) in Haskell, a Functional Programming language, on the Travelling Salesman Person problem (which will be referred as TSP).

The project contains a documentation in Doku folder which addresses the results of ACO + TSP on different benchmarks and also TSP + 3 different algorithms.
